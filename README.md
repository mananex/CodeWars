# My CodeWars 

#### Here are all my solved katas from CodeWars!

Each folder in this repository contains solved katas of the corresponding level. That is, in the folder "8 kyu" solved katas of complexity 8 kyu and so on.

<hr>

#### Each script contains information about the kata name and a link to it.**
For example:

```
# --------------------------------------------- #
# --- #     kata - Bartender, drinks!     # --- #
# --- #   kata/568dc014440f03b13900001d   # --- #
# --------------------------------------------- #
```

After "kata" - the name of the kata. After it - a link to the kata itself.
